# PickHacks2024
A project for the 2024 PickHacks Hackathon hosted by Missouri Science and Technology
The Theme is security and for this, we will be using a hand sensor to create a unique password to open devices.
Using two hands the user will use different hand signals to create a password.
The left hand will be used to determine which digit of the password you are entering.
To reduce complexity the right hand will only be able to enter any number from 0-5. I.E (Closed fist is 0, one finger out is 1, and so on)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application of this password system would be to open any real-world device using the _____ sensor.
It can bolster any security system to require a hand-signed code. 
Our project will be surface level only allowing numbers (0-5).
The reaching goal would be allowing different hand configurations to mean different values and allow for both hands to be used within the password.
